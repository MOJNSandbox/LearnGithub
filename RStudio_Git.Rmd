**Using Git at the command line**
------------------------------------------
### Broad Concept
There are three places where Git keeps track of changes to your project: the working copy, the staging area, and the repository.

#### The Working Copy
This is where you make changes. It's just your normal project files -- nothing unfamiliar here.

#### The Staging Area
The cool thing about Git is that it lets you keep track of your changes in a series of snapshots, which you can go back and look at and undo if necessary. This is most useful when each snapshot represents a small number of changes that are closely related. That way, if you need to undo a snapshot, you won't be undoing other, unrelated work that you wanted to keep.
This is where the staging area comes in. Things you put in the staging area will be part of a single snapshot. So, once you've made some changes in the working copy, you can pick and choose which changes belong together in a snapshot by staging just those changes. Once you've saved the snapshot, you can stage some other changes that belong in a separate snapshot, and so on until all of your changes are saved.

#### The Repository
The repository (saved history) in Git consists of a series of snapshots. Each snapshot represents a set of changes and stores information about who took the snapshot, which snapshot came before it, and a brief user-supplied message about what changes were made.

### Getting Started
To initialize a repository, right click on the folder containing your project and select **Git bash here** to open the Git command line. Type `git init` at the command line. This initializes an empty repository in your project folder.

### Saving Changes
To add a changed file to the staging area, type `git add [filename]`. You can do this for as many files as you would like to include in the next snapshot.

To actually save the snapshot, type `git commit -m '[your message here]'`. Your message should be brief but should indicate what was done.

### Branching
To add a branch, first make sure you're on the branch you want to add to.  Then click the (purple) branch icon under the Git tabin R Studio.  Name the branch and tell it to "Sync branch with remote" (i.e., GitHub).

### Troubleshooting
Put the trouble in a bubble.

**Using Git in RStudio**
-----------------------------------------
### Enabling Git

#. Go to Tools -> Global Options -> Git/SVN
#. Check the box next to **Enable version control interface for RStudio projects**
#. Under **Git executable**, provide the path to your computer's Git installation (probably C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe)

### Getting Started {.tabset .tabset-pills}

Start from...

#### Scratch

#. Go to File -> New Project
#. In the window that pops up, select **New Directory**
#. Select **New Project**
#. Pick a name for your project directory, and choose where it will be stored
#. Make sure to check the box next to **Create a git repository**
#. Click **Create Project**

#### Existing R Project

Go <https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects>[link](**here**) for more information about projects in RStudio.

#. Open the project in RStudio
#. Go to Tools -> Project Options -> Git/SVN
#. Set **Version control system:** to **Git**
#. RStudio will ask if you want to initialize a new git repository; select **Yes**
#. RStudio will say that it needs to restart to apply your changes; select **Yes**

#### Existing GitHub Repo

#. Go to File -> New Project
#. In the window that pops up, select **Version Control**
#. Select **Git**
#. Enter the repository URL
#. Pick a name for your project directory, and choose where it will be stored
#. Click **Create Project**

### Basic Git operations

### Troubleshooting
Bring the trouble down to rubble.

**Using GitHub**
------------------------------------------

### Getting Started {.tabset .tabset-pills}

Start from...

#### Existing Local Repo

#### GitHub Repo - Your Project

#### GitHub Repo - Someone Else's Project
