## Why?

- Sort of like change tracking in Word or Google Docs
- Collaborate without silently erasing someone else's work
- Edit your own work while keeping the option to undo those edits

## Why?

- The difference:
    - Code can break!
    - One project may involve many files
- We need a way to take "snapshots" of our code at a given point in time
- When we make modifications to working code, we want to be able to revert back to the working version if things go south
    - We also want to make sure that anyone who is using our code can still access the working version while we are making our updates

## Git and Github

- Git
    - Version control software
    - Installed locally on your computer
    - Tracks changes to files in your project directory (aka repository)
    - Lets you create multiple "branches"
        - Master branch contains the most up-to-date working version of the project
        - Use other branches to develop new functionality
            - Merge changes back into master branch when you're sure they work
- Github
    - Website that hosts Git repositories
    - Lots of great collaboration features
    - Looks great on a resume!

## Git Workflow
- Start a new project
    - Initialize a local Git repository (`git init`)
    - Add project files to your repository (`git add [filename]`)
        - Can create files before or after initializing repo

## Git Workflow
- Work on a project
    - Create a new branch (`git branch [branch name]; git checkout [branch name]`)
    - Work on project, commit changes, repeat (`git commit -m "[descriptive message]"`)
    - When the code works, merge with master branch (`git checkout master; git merge [branch name]`)
    - Repeat!

## Git Basics
### Open Git Command Line
- Right click on project folder and select "Git Bash Here"

## Git Basics
### Initialize A Repository
- `git init`
- Tells Git to generate all the files it will need in order to keep track of your project folder and its contents

## Git Basics
### Check Status
- `git status`
- What branch am I on? What is the status of the files in my repository?

## Git Basics
### Add Files To The Staging Area
- `git add [filename]` adds a specific file
- `git add *.R` adds all R files in the project folder
- `git add *` adds all files in the project folder
- Tells Git to track changes to these files

## Git Basics
### Create a New Branch
- `git branch`
    - List current branches
- `git branch [branch name]`
    - Create new branch
- `git checkout [branch name]`
    - Switch to new branch

## Git Basics
### Commit changes
- `git commit -m "[descriptive message]"`
- Permanently records snapshots of staged files

## Git Basics
### Merge Branches
- `git checkout master`
    - Switch to master branch
- `git merge [branch name]`
    - Merge everything from a specific branch into the master branch
- `git branch -d [branch name]`
    - Delete old branch
    
## Git Basics
### View Version History and Revert to Older Version
- `git log`
    - View version history for current branch
- `git reset [commit]`
    - Undoes commits after `[commit]` but leaves files as is
- `git reset --hard [commit]`
    - Undoes commits after `[commit]` and resets files to their state at that commit


    
## Git Basics
### Rules of Thumb
- One repository per project
    - Good: MOJN_IU_CalibrationAnalysis
    - Bad: MOJN_R_Code
- Commit early and often
- Use descriptive commit messages
    - Your collaborators and future self will thank you!
