## Why?
- Sort of like change tracking in Word or Google Docs
- Collaborate without silently erasing someone else's work
- Edit your own work while keeping the option to undo those edits

## Why?
- The difference:
    - Code can break!
    - One project may involve many files
- We need a way to take "snapshots" of our code at a given point in time
- When we make modifications to working code, we want to be able to revert back to the working version if things go south
    - We also want to make sure that anyone who is using our code can still access the working version while we are making our updates

## Git and GitHub
- Git
    - Version control software
    - Installed locally on your computer
    - Tracks changes to files in your project directory (aka repository)
    - Lets you create multiple "branches"
        - Master branch contains the most up-to-date working version of the project
        - Use other branches to develop new functionality
            - Merge changes back into master branch when you're sure they work

## Git and GitHub
- GitHub
    - Website that hosts Git repositories
    - Great for collaboration

## Git Workflow
- Start a new project
    - Initialize a local Git repository 
        - `git init`
    - Add project files to the staging area
        - `git add [filename]`
        - Can create files before or after initializing repo
    - Commit initial project files
        - `git commit -m "Initial project files"`

## Git Workflow
- Work on a project
    - Create a new branch
        - `git branch [branch name]`
        - `git checkout [branch name]`
    - Work on project, stage changes, commit changes, repeat 
        - `git add [filename]`
        - `git commit -m "[descriptive message]"`
    - When the code works, merge with master branch 
        - `git checkout master; git merge [branch name]`
    - Repeat!

## Git Basics
### Open Git Command Line
- Right click on project folder and select "Git Bash Here"

![](images/GitBashHere.png)

## Git Basics
### Initialize A Repository
- `git init`
- Tells Git to generate all the files it will need in order to keep track of your project folder and its contents

## Git Basics
### Check Status
- `git status`
- What branch am I on? What is the status of the files in my repository?

## Git Basics
### Add Files To The Staging Area
- `git add [filename]` 
    - stages a specific file
- `git add *.R` 
    - stages all R files in the project folder
- `git add *`
    - stages all files in the project folder
- Tells Git to include changes to these files in the next commit

## Git Basics
### Create a New Branch
- `git branch`
    - List current branches
- `git branch [branch name]`
    - Create new branch
- `git checkout [branch name]`
    - Switch to new branch

## Git Basics
### Commit changes
- `git commit -m "[descriptive message]"`
- Record a snapshot of staged files

## Git Basics
### Merge Branches
- `git checkout master`
    - Switch to master branch
- `git merge [branch name]`
    - Merge everything from a specific branch into the master branch
- `git branch -d [branch name]`
    - Delete old branches when you're done with them
    
## Git Basics
### View Version History and Revert to Older Version
- `git log`
    - View commit history for current branch
- `git checkout [commit]`
    - Set the working directory to its state at `[commit]`
    - When you checkout a commit, you are no longer on a branch, so commits you make from here will not be saved!

## Git Basics
### Undo a Commit
- `git revert [commit]`
    - Create a new commit that undoes the specified commit

## GitHub Workflow
- Start a new project
    - Create remote repository on GitHub
    - Initialize local repository, make an initial commit
    - Set the GitHub repository as the remote repository where the local repository will be pushed
    - Push changes in the local repository to GitHub
    
## GitHub Workflow
- Work on a project
    - Incorporate changes made by others into your local repository
    - Work in your local repository as usual
    - Push your work to GitHub

## GitHub Basics
### Create a GitHub Repository

![](images/NewRepository.png)

## GitHub Basics
### Set a GitHub Repository as the Default Remote Repository
- `git remote add origin [GitHub repository URL]`
    - Set the GitHub repository as the remote repository where the local repository will be pushed

## GitHub Basics
### Push Local Changes to GitHub Repository
- `git push origin [branch name]`
    - Push changes in a specific branch to GitHub
    
## GitHub Basics
### Sync Local Repository with GitHub Repository
- `git checkout master; git pull`
    - Checkout the local master branch, fetch the master branch from GitHub, and merge it into the current local branch
    - This brings the local master branch up to date with the master branch on GitHub
- `git checkout [feature branch]; git merge master`
    - Merge the local master branch (now up to date with the remote master branch) into the local branch you are working in
    - Now the branch you are working in is up to date with the local and remote master branches

## Rules of Thumb
- One repository per project
    - Good: MOJN_IU_CalibrationAnalysis
    - Bad: MOJN_R_Code
- Commit early and often
- Use descriptive commit messages
    - Your collaborators and future self will thank you!
